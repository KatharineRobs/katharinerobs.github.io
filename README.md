# Technical Writer

From mining to video games, I've got over 10 years of writing and content creation experience, including delivering user-friendly documentation for three of the world's leading game engines. I'm keen on translating and authoring complex technical concepts for global audiences. I've supported docs for:

* Epic Games
* Electronic Arts (EA)
* Unity
* Diligent
* Sepro Mineral Systems Corp.

**Note**: EA work specifics are under NDA.

## Epic Games
