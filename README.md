# Technical Writer

![Epic Games](assets/company-logos.png)

From building mining equipment manuals to crafting online tutorials for game devs, 10+ years of writing experience taught me that every industry wants (and deserves) clear and maintainable documentation. I'm keen on translating and authoring complex technical concepts for global audiences (aka I like a challenge). I've worked for:

* Epic Games
* Electronic Arts (EA)  
**Note**: EA, including Frostbite and EA Sports, work specifics are under NDA.
* Unity
* Diligent
* Sepro Mineral Systems Corp.  
  **Note**: Sepro equipment manuals are only available in printed hardcopies: 300-plus page binders packed with blueprints, steps, safety warnings, and screenshots.

## What I made 

I wrote the following samples to fit each company's style guide standards. I either authored the initial version and maintained it or updated an existing page. 

### Epic Games

* **[Tool: Bulk Import / Export](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services/eos-fundamentals/tools/bulk-importer-exporter-tool)**: A guide on using the import/export tool that went through several revisions. To make this single page feel less like a beast, I added all file format requirements to an expanding accordian menu.
* **[Request Approval to Use the Unreal Engine Logo](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/dev-portal/unreal-engine/ue-trademark-license)**: New page and a lot of collaboration between devs and marketing. Had to be the tech writing/marketing translator for this one.

### Unity

I authored the initial pages and maintained them through engine updates. 

* **[Get started with Unity Ads in-app bidding in Unity LevelPlay](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/grow/dashboard/bidding/levelplay)**
* **[Manage ad units and placements](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/grow/dashboard/ad-units/manage)** 

### Diligent 

* **[Delete an objective (HighBond API)](https://docs-apis.highbond.com/#operation/deleteObjective)**: A developer wrote the first draft - I just reviewed and edited the piece.
* **Utility Toolbar**:
  * [Release notes](https://help.diligentoneplatform.com/helpdocs/d1p/en-us/Content/release_notes/release-notes-projects.htm?Highlight=unlink%20project%20risk%20category%20#:~:text=Introducing%20Utility%20Toolbar)
  * [Project side panels](https://help.diligentoneplatform.com/helpdocs/d1p/en-us/Content/projects/getting_started/getting_started.html#side:~:text=bulk%20upload%20capabilities-,Project%20side%20panels,-Project%20side%20panels)
