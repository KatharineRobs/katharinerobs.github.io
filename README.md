# Technical Writer

I've got over 10 years of writing experience, as seen in thick binders of mining equipment manuals and tutorials for building video games. I'm keen on translating and authoring complex technical concepts for global audiences. I've written docs for:

* Epic Games
* Electronic Arts (EA)
* Unity
* Diligent
* Sepro Mineral Systems Corp.

**Note**: EA work specifics are under NDA.

## Epic Games

The following pages were updated to fit Epic Online Services' style guide standards.

* **[Tool: Bulk Import / Export](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services/eos-fundamentals/tools/bulk-importer-exporter-tool)**: Full page makeover, including rearranging samples and steps.
* **[Request Approval to Use the Unreal Engine Logo](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services/eos-fundamentals/tools/bulk-importer-exporter-tool)**: Entire page was created from scratch.
