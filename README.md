# Technical Writer

I've got over 10 years of writing experience (like building thick binders of mining equipment manuals and online tutorials for video game developers). I'm keen on translating and authoring complex technical concepts for global audiences. I've worked for:

* Epic Games
* Electronic Arts (EA)
* Unity
* Diligent
* Sepro Mineral Systems Corp.

**Note**: EA work specifics are under NDA.

## Epic Games

The following pages were updated to fit Epic Online Services' style guide standards.

* **[Tool: Bulk Import / Export](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services/eos-fundamentals/tools/bulk-importer-exporter-tool)**: Full page makeover, including rearranging samples and steps.
* **[Request Approval to Use the Unreal Engine Logo](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/dev-portal/unreal-engine/ue-trademark-license)**: Entire page was created from scratch.
