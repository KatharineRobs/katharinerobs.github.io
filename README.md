# Technical Writer

From printing and shipping thick stacks of mining equipment manuals to how-to tutorials on building video games, I've got over 10 years of writing experience, including doc support for three of the world's leading game engines. I'm keen on translating and authoring complex technical concepts for global audiences. I've written docs for:

* Epic Games
* Electronic Arts (EA)
* Unity
* Diligent
* Sepro Mineral Systems Corp.

**Note**: EA work specifics are under NDA.
